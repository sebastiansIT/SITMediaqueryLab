Playing around with CSS Mediaqueries

This is an little collection of snippets testing different CSS Media Queries.
I have written it a long time ago but sometimes I find a new interesting thing
to add her.

You can find a deployed Version on http://lab.human-injection.de/mediaqueries/.

Play around if you like and send me your feedback. Thanks.
